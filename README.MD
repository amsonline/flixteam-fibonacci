After creating the interface, I started to think how can I implement the method to get best result.
I have created the class and implemented the interface. Also, I have created the index.php file to check out is the class working fine or not.

The method is working fine, but the code is not clean, and it needs refactor. Also, I didn't write any unit tests yet.
